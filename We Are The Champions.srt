00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,610
Lyrics Freddie Mercury

3
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:00,920
Composed Freddie Mercury

4
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,420
I've paid my dues

5
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,850
Time after time

6
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,460
I've done my sentence

7
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,580
But committed no crime

8
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,660
And bad mistakes

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,640
I've made a few

10
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,470
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,810
But I've come through

12
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:34,390
And I need to go on and on and on and on

13
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,830
We are the champions my friends

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,200
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,400
We are the champions

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,160
We are the champions

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,700
No time for losers

18
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,870
'Cause we are the champions

19
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:12,250
Of the world

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,200
I've taken my bows

21
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,100
And my curtain calls

22
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,340
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it

23
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,480
I thank you all

24
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,450
But it's been no bed of roses

25
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,930
No pleasure cruise

26
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,630
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race

27
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,850
And I ain't gonna lose

28
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,300
And I need to go on and on and on and on

29
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,840
We are the champions my friends

30
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,950
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end

31
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,440
We are the champions

32
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,240
We are the champions

33
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,680
No time for losers

34
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,870
'Cause we are the champions

35
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,730
Of the world

36
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,890
We are the champions my friends

37
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:37,550
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end oh

38
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,280
We are the champions

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,960
We are the champions

40
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,410
No time for losers

41
00:02:48,410 --> 00:36:08,410
'Cause we are the champions
