1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,500
It's a kind of magic

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,380
It's a kind of magic

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,900
A kind of magic

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:18,070
One dream one soul one prize one goal

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:24,260
One golden glance of what should be

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,660
It's a kind of magic

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,710
One shaft of light that shows the way

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,890
No mortal man can win this day

9
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,350
It's a kind of magic

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,910
The bell that rings inside your mind

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,630
Is challenging the doors of time

12
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,170
It's a kind of magic

13
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,810
The waiting seems eternity

14
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:09,260
The day will dawn of sanity

15
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:15,730
Is this a kind of magic

16
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,170
It's a kind of magic

17
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:22,250
There can be only one

18
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:31,410
This rage that lasts a thousand years

19
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,420
Will soon be done

20
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:41,410
This flame that burns inside of me

21
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm here in secret harmonies

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,430
It's a kind of magic

23
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,740
The bell that rings inside your mind

24
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:05,890
Is challenging the doors of time

25
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,160
It's a kind of magic

26
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,790
It's a kind of magic

27
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:41,020
This rage that lasts a thousand years

28
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,460
Will soon be will soon be

29
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,240
Will soon be done

30
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,510
This is a kind of magic

31
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,620
There can be only one

32
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,140
This rage that lasts a thousand years

33
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,660
Will soon be done-done

34
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,530
