00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.300
We Are The Champions   - Queen

00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.610
Lyrics Freddie Mercury

00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:00.920
Composed Freddie Mercury

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.420
I've paid my dues

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.850
Time after time

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.460
I've done my sentence

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.580
But committed no crime

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.660
And bad mistakes

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.640
I've made a few

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.470
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.810
But I've come through

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.390
And I need to go on and on and on and on

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.830
We are the champions my friends

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.200
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.400
We are the champions

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.160
We are the champions

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.700
No time for losers

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.870
'Cause we are the champions

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.250
Of the world

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.200
I've taken my bows

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.100
And my curtain calls

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.340
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.480
I thank you all

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.450
But it's been no bed of roses

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.930
No pleasure cruise

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.630
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.850
And I ain't gonna lose

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.300
And I need to go on and on and on and on

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.840
We are the champions my friends

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.950
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.440
We are the champions

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.240
We are the champions

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.680
No time for losers

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.870
'Cause we are the champions

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.730
Of the world

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.890
We are the champions my friends

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:37.550
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end oh

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.280
We are the champions

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.960
We are the champions

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.410
No time for losers

00:02:48.410 --> 00:36:08.410
'Cause we are the champions
